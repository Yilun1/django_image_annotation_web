This is a tutorial on how to use the online annotation tool in this project

the tool uses polygons for detection results and text in a rectangle for recognition results

"click" and "drag" is the basic mouse operations in this tool
"drag" means keep pressing left mouse button and moving the mouse

create new polygons and rectangles:
click to create new vertex
press "T" to switch from polygon vertex to rectangle vertex
press "F" to link three or more polygon vertexes and create a polygon
after creating two rectangle vertexes on a diagonal, the rectangle is automatically created

add vertexes to existing polygon:
click the interior of a polygon
do not move the mouse while clicking in case you drag it instead of adding vertexes
then click to add vertexes to the polygon
press "A" to quit this operation

delete a polygon or rectangle:
click on any vertex of a polygon or rectangle
after clicking, press "E" to delete it

drag a rectangle or polygon, or a single vertex:
press the left mouse button on a vertex, then keep pressing and move the mouse to drag it
press the right mouse button on the interior of a polygon, then keep pressing and move the mouse

add text recognition results to the rectangle:
click(don't drag) the interior of a rectangle and the input box get focus
press enter after typing the text, the text will appear inside the rectangle

set up a 1-1 relationship of rectangle and polygon:
this operation is to specify which text  belongs to which polygon
click the interior of a rectangle and then click the interior of a polygon
if all existing polygons already have recognition results
then click the interior of a rectangle again to end this operation

use the automatic detection algorithm:
before manual annotation, click the pre-detect button
wait for some time, the result will appear on canvas
then you can manually edit the annotation made by the algorithm

save the result:
click the save button, the result will be downloaded as two files
one is a text file containing the detection results in polygon area and text recognition results in  
one is an image converted from the canvas
